Technology Assessment - Mobile Project

This app supports iPhones and iPads running iOS 10. Built with Xcode Version 12.3 (12C33). Written in Swift 5.1.

This sample project initially displays a list of the most popular New York Times articles from the last 7 days  using API from New York Times. The user should also be able to click on one of the returned articles and view the whole article in a web browser.

The app was written in Swift. 

Also, after research, design, and writing the code, this project took somewhere between 10 and 12 hours.

I look forward to your feedback, and to explain more the project!
